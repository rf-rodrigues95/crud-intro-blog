# Personal Blogging Platform API

This is an introductory backend project built with **Java Spring Boot** and **PostgreSQL**, designed to simulate the core functionality of a personal blogging platform.

The API exposes endpoints that allow for basic **CRUD operations** on blog posts. It demonstrates how to structure a RESTful service using Spring Boot with persistence handled via Spring Data JPA and PostgreSQL.

This project serves as a foundation for understanding the structure and flow of backend services using Spring Boot. It can easily be extended to include authentication, pagination, and article listing features.
